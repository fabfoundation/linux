# Linux for Fab

> This is WIP

Linux for Fab are a couple of Linux distributions preloaded with software and settings for Fab Labs, Makerspaces and the like. It has been created to make it easier for you to adopt Linux. The original idea came from our beloved [Nadya Peek](http://infosyncratic.nl/) who created this awesome [post-install script](https://gist.github.com/pral2a/7804545fc55b14ad0bef) for Ubuntu.

Like in all things in life there are two options.

## For beginners: Ubuntu

This distribution is maintaned by [Sibu Saman](https://github.com/sibusaman)

Ubuntu is the recommended option if you have never used Linux before or if you don't really want to mess with the internals of Linux. Just plug-n-play and get things done.

## For ninjas: Arch

This distribution is maintaned by [Francisco Sanchez](https://github.com/TheBeachLab)

Arch is our way to push you out of your comfort zone. Expect a lot of command line usage. You will learn how Linux work by fixing and personalizing your operating system.
